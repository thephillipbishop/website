            <p>Hey guys! I just dropped this shower thought for you all and I thought I would share it! I really worked hard thinking this one up for you and I really hope you guys like it! Also, i have been making some really lovely films for you all! I really hope you check them out. There is one about rock paper scissors, a game we all truly know and love. Also paradoxes that is perplexing and one more soon!

🦅 EAGLES!!! 🦅 That’s what we are! 🦅 Anyway, back to the 🚿 shower thought! Just to remind you we are the 21st edition of the shower thought! That’s just like the year we’re in! 🌍 The 21st century! Isn’t that a ✨ nice coincidence ✨?

Anyway 🫧 back to the shower thought 💭 isn’t it kinda funny 😂 how the different grammar rules 📚 can sometimes not be ruling 👑? Like, if you think about it 🤔, grammar isn’t always 12 inches 📏kind of like my ruler! My ruler is yellow 💛 and a foot long 🦶 kind of like those 🚇 Subway trains with 🥪 sandwiches!

Sorry 😅 I’m getting off track 🚂 (like train tracks 🛤️)! Anyway, back to the shower thought 🚿💭!

If you look at the months of the year 🗓️, there are 12 of them  kind of like this shower thought if you flipped it 🔄! Sorry 😬 off the train tracks again 🚆, back to the shower thought!

For example, my birthday 🎂 is in September 🍂! Many events have happened in September 📜, but that’s a thought for another time ⏰  back to the shower thought!

One such month of the year is March 🚶! Now March is a funny one 😄 because it has many meanings. Words like “tire” 🛞 also have many meanings  it could be the physical tire you can roll around in 🌀 or it can refer to being tired 😴 after you’re done rolling!

Sorry again 🥴off topic! Back to the video 🎥 sorry I mean shower thought 🚿💦!

March is both a month 🗓️ and an action 💃 referring to a fancy walk 🫡 kind of like how elephants 🐘 sorry 😅 got off track again 🚂! I won’t dive into this elephant in the room 🐘🚪.

Now grammar is funny 🤓 because depending on when something happens ⏳, the word changes 🔄. For example:
✍️ I am writing this shower thought,
📖 but when you read it, I will have written the shower thought!

“Writing” and “written” ✏️ refer to the same action but in a different place in time 🕰️.

Now apply this to March and you can see the confusion 🤯!
📅 January and February could both be called Will March, because they’re before March.
📅 April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December could all be called Marched, because they’re after March!

Just something to think about 🧠 that I thought about 💭 so we can share this idea together 🤝  connecting on a truly mental level 🌀.

🙏 Thank you all for continually supporting my channel 🎥💖 I truly could not have made it this far without you 🫶.

You guys literally saved my life 💪. One time I was being robbed 🏃💨 and the robber said,

“If you don’t have more than 44 subscribers on YouTube, I will rob you.” 😱

So I showed him my channel 📱 and here I am today 😎🎉.

            "🚿PBST #6 Hey Eagles! We're trying a new style for Phillip Bishop Shower Thoughts today! Looking for a more lowkey casual vibe if you know what I mean, you feel me?  Any-who, I was in the shower thinking about the way that all things are. Like everything is related to something else in someway. There's not a single two objects that cannot have a connection drawn between them! Sorta like that one game \"Connections\" by New York Times!  Connections Puzzle #662 🟨🟨🟨🟨 🟩🟩🟩🟩 🟦🟦🟦🟦 🟪🟪🟪🟪 Not to toot my own horn, but I'm pretty good at this. My grandkids hate me for it haha",

            "🚿PBST #20 👋😃✨ HELLO!!! 🎉🎊 Welcome 🏠➡️ to my 🎂20️⃣th anniversary 🎉 of my 🚿🤯 shower thoughts 💭💦!!! 🤪 Crazy 🤯😱 to think 🤔🧠 that we 👫👬👭 have been doing 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️ this for 🕰️ TWENTY YEARS!!! 2️⃣0️⃣🗓️ Anyway ➡️, onto the 🧼 washed 🧽💡 idea 💭!!! 🎄🎅 Now that X-Mas 🎁⛄ is right around the corner 🔄📐, Santa 🎅🛷✨ is really keeping 👀👁️ a keen eye 👁️🔍👁️ on us all 🌍👫 (for those 🙋‍♀️🙋 that still believe 🌟🙏 anyway). This is how 👈👉 he knows 🧠📜 which list 📃📝 we go 🚶➡️ on — the good ✅😇 one being the 👍 NICE list 😇✨📜, and the bad ❌😈 one being the 🚫 NAUGHTY list 😈🔥📜. Now I must say 🗣️ that I have once 1️⃣☝️ been on the naughty 😈 list 📜. Back in 🕰️1639 📜📆, Charles 👑 I began the First 1️⃣ Bishops' War ⚔️⛪🔥. I (obviously 🙄👀) was the leader 👑🚩 of it. Then, much much later 🕰️⏭️, in 1976 📼📆, my great-grandmama 👵👑 asked ❓ me about her September 🍂☁️ skies 🌌. She asked 🗣️ me a very tricky 🕵️‍♂️😵 question ❓❔. She asked if I could see 👀🔭 the ☁️ cloud ☁️ that looked 👀➡️ like a rolling 🌀 hill 🌄 with a castle 🏰 and there was a 👧 girl 👩 on the battlements 🛡️🏰 of the castle 🏰 who was looking 👀➡️ over the hills 🌄🌄 towards the mountains 🏔️⛰️ that were reaching 🙌 up into the cloud ☁️ where there was an avalanche ❄️⛷️🌨️ falling ⬇️ onto the rabbit 🐇 hill 🌄 with snakes 🐍 instead of rabbits 🐇 that wore funny 🤡 little hats 🎩🎓🧢 that were having tea 🍵☕🫖 from T-shaped 🔤🔠 teacups 🍵🍵🍵 on Saturday 📅🗓️ I, not wanting 🚫🙅 to offend 😬 her, said 🗣️ yes ✅✔️. This was a lie 🤥🤫. I had no idea 🤷 what she was talking 🗣️ about. She was ill 🤒🧠, mentally 🧠⚠️, if you catch 🕵️‍♂️ my drift 🌬️💨. She IMMEDIATELY 🏃‍♀️💨 could tell 🧠👀 I was lying 🤥 because I've always been bad 👎 at poker ♠️♥️♣️♦️🎲🎰 because my face 😐➡️🙃 is kind of on backwards 🔄😵. Because she knew 🧠👀 I was lying 🤥, she had me sit 🪑⬇️ down in the village 🏘️ well ⛲💧 at the bottom ⬇️ and write 📝 a letter ✉️📨 to Santa 🎅 and Satan 😈🔥. (TLDR ⏩📖, this is new 🆕). The letter ✉️ to Santa 🎅 was that I lied 🤥 and was bad 😈 and would likely 🔮 have to be ➡️ on the naughty list 📜😈. The letter ✉️ to Satan 😈🔥 was to ask 🙏 him to please 🙏😭 not send 🚚➡️ me to H-E 🍺🍺 double hockey 🏒🏒 sticks 🔥🔥 for lying 🤥 because that is bad ❌😡 to do. So moral 📚 of the story 📖📜, whenever ⏰ you do something bad 😈💩, write ✍️ a letter ✉️ to two 2️⃣ people 👥 in order to get away 🏃💨 from the repercussions ⚡⚠️. Always 🔁 keep in mind 🧠 which list 📜 the action 🎬➡️ you may do will put ➡️ you on 👤📌, because if you are on the naughty list 📜😈, you won't 🚫 get 🎁 anything but coal 🪨🖤 for X-Mas 🎄🎁. Some people 👥👫 also think 🤔 that Krampus 👹 will get 🏃‍♂️➡️ you, but that's neither ➡️⛔ here ⬅️ nor ➡️ there ⬅️. Anyway ➡️, stay safe 🦺😷 out there 🌍, make sure ✔️✅ you wear 🧥 a coat 🧥🧣🧤!!! ❄️🥶",
            "🚿PBST #21 🦅 EAGLES!!! 🦅 That’s what we are! 🦅 Anyway, back to the 🚿 shower thought! Just to remind you we are the 21st edition of the shower thought! That’s just like the year we’re in! 🌍 The 21st century! Isn’t that a ✨ nice coincidence ✨? Anyway 🫧 back to the shower thought 💭 isn’t it kinda funny 😂 how the different grammar rules 📚 can sometimes not be ruling 👑? Like, if you think about it 🤔, grammar isn’t always 12 inches 📏kind of like my ruler! My ruler is yellow 💛 and a foot long 🦶 kind of like those 🚇 Subway trains with 🥪 sandwiches! Sorry 😅 I’m getting off track 🚂 (like train tracks 🛤️)! Anyway, back to the shower thought 🚿💭! If you look at the months of the year 🗓️, there are 12 of them  kind of like this shower thought if you flipped it 🔄! Sorry 😬 off the train tracks again 🚆, back to the shower thought! For example, my birthday 🎂 is in September 🍂! Many events have happened in September 📜, but that’s a thought for another time ⏰  back to the shower thought! One such month of the year is March 🚶! Now March is a funny one 😄 because it has many meanings. Words like “tire” 🛞 also have many meanings  it could be the physical tire you can roll around in 🌀 or it can refer to being tired 😴 after you’re done rolling! Sorry again 🥴off topic! Back to the video 🎥 sorry I mean shower thought 🚿💦! March is both a month 🗓️ and an action 💃 referring to a fancy walk 🫡 kind of like how elephants 🐘 sorry 😅 got off track again 🚂! I won’t dive into this elephant in the room 🐘🚪. Now grammar is funny 🤓 because depending on when something happens ⏳, the word changes 🔄. For example: ✍️ I am writing this shower thought,📖 but when you read it, I will have written the shower thought! “Writing” and “written” ✏️ refer to the same action but in a different place in time 🕰️. Now apply this to March and you can see the confusion 🤯! 📅 January and February could both be called Will March, because they’re before March. 📅 April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December could all be called Marched, because they’re after March! Just something to think about 🧠 that I thought about 💭 so we can share this idea together 🤝  connecting on a truly mental level 🌀. 🙏 Thank you all for continually supporting my channel 🎥💖 I truly could not have made it this far without you 🫶. You guys literally saved my life 💪. One time I was being robbed 🏃💨 and the robber said, “If you don’t have more than 44 subscribers on YouTube, I will rob you.” 😱 So I showed him my channel 📱 and here I am today 😎🎉.
